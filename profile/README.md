# Overview

CM Library Archvies and Special Collections uses this GitHub Organization to organize projects (using individual repos) and overall documentation (using GitHub Pages). Community members and interested parties can view the documentation in a human-friendly format on <a href="https://cml-asc.github.io" target=_blank>cml-asc.github.io</a>.

We do not use the wiki function of GitHub repos due to limited functionality and a lack of versioning.

README documents in individual repos are high level and detailed documentation lives on our GitHub Pages.
